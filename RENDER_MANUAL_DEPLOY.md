# How to Deploy to Render Right Now

## Current Status
All code changes have been pushed to GitHub. Now you need to trigger Render deployment.

## Option 1: Manual Deploy (Fastest)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click on your service**: `gemini-ludo-game`
3. **Click "Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
4. **Select**: "Deploy latest commit"
5. **Wait for deployment** to complete (check Events/Logs tab)

## Option 2: Verify Auto-Deploy is Enabled

If you want Render to auto-deploy on future pushes:

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click on**: `gemini-ludo-game` service
3. **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
4. **Check**: "Auto-Deploy" should be set to **"Yes"**
5. **If not**: Change it to "Yes" and save

## Option 3: Reconnect Repository (If Not Connected)

If Render isn't connected:

1. **Settings** → **Repository**
2. **Click**: "Connect Repository" or "Change Repository"
3. **Select**: `iheykal/studio`
4. **Branch**: `main`
5. **Root Directory**: Leave empty (`.`)
6. **Save** - This will trigger a deployment

## Verify Deployment

After triggering deployment:

1. **Check Events tab** - Should show "Deploy in progress" or "Deploy succeeded"
2. **Check Logs tab** - Should show build output:
   - `npm run render:build` executing
   - Frontend build completing
   - Server starting
3. **Visit your deployed URL** - Should show the latest version
