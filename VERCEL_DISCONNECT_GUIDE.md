# How to Completely Stop Vercel Deployments

## The Problem
Even after renaming `vercel.json`, Vercel is still deploying because it's **connected to your GitHub repository** at the dashboard level.

## Solution: Disconnect Vercel from GitHub

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Log in to your account

### Step 2: Find Your Project
1. Look for project: **"studio"** or **"efficient-playfulness"**
2. Click on the project

### Step 3: Disconnect Repository
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **"Git"** section
3. Click **"Disconnect"** button next to the connected repository
4. Confirm the disconnection

### Step 4: Alternative - Disable Auto-Deploy
If you want to keep it connected but stop auto-deploy:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
2. Toggle **"Auto-Deploy"** to **OFF**
3. Save changes

## Step 5: Verify Render Connection

After disconnecting Vercel:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Check your service**: `gemini-ludo-game`
3. **Settings** → **Repository**:
   - Repository: `iheykal/studio`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Should show as **"Connected"**
4. **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**:
   - Auto-Deploy: Should be **"Yes"**

## Step 6: Test Deployment

1. **Make a small change** (or wait for next push)
2. **Check Render Dashboard** - should see new deployment
3. **Check Vercel Dashboard** - should NOT see new deployment

## If You Can't Access Vercel Dashboard

If you don't have access or can't find the project:

1. **Check GitHub Webhooks**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/iheykal/studio/settings/hooks
   - Look for Vercel webhooks
   - Delete any Vercel webhooks

2. **Contact Vercel Support**:
   - They can help disconnect the repository
   - Or delete the project if you don't need it

## Additional Protection

I've also created:
- `.vercelignore` file - tells Vercel to ignore the project
- `vercel.json.disabled` - renamed the config file

But the **most important step** is disconnecting in the Vercel dashboard.
