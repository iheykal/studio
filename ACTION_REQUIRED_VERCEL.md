# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Remove Vercel NOW

## 🚨 You MUST Do These Steps Manually

Code changes have been pushed, but **you MUST manually remove Vercel** from GitHub and Vercel dashboard.

## Step 1: Remove Vercel Webhooks (5 minutes) ⚠️ CRITICAL

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/iheykal/studio/settings/hooks
2. **Look for webhooks** with:
   - URL containing `vercel.com` or `vercel.app`
   - Name containing "Vercel"
3. **Click on each one**
4. **Scroll down** → Click **"Delete webhook"**
5. **Confirm deletion**

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT step** - webhooks trigger Vercel on every push!

## Step 2: Remove Vercel GitHub App (2 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/installations
2. **Find "Vercel"** in the list
3. **Click "Configure"**
4. **Click "Uninstall"** or remove access to `iheykal/studio`
5. **Confirm**

## Step 3: Disconnect in Vercel Dashboard (2 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find project**: "studio" or "efficient-playfulness"
3. **Click on project**
4. **Settings** → **Git** section
5. **Click "Disconnect"** button
6. **Confirm disconnection**

## Step 4: Verify Removal

1. **Check webhooks**: https://github.com/iheykal/studio/settings/hooks
   - Should show NO Vercel webhooks

2. **Test**: Make a small change and push
   - Vercel should NOT deploy
   - Render should deploy (if connected)

## Why Code Changes Aren't Enough

- ✅ Renamed `vercel.json` → `vercel.json.disabled`
- ✅ Added `.vercelignore`
- ✅ Added GitHub Actions workflow
- ❌ **BUT**: Vercel webhook in GitHub still triggers deployments
- ❌ **BUT**: Vercel project still connected to repository

**You MUST remove the webhook and disconnect in dashboard!**

## Quick Links

- **GitHub Webhooks**: https://github.com/iheykal/studio/settings/hooks
- **GitHub Integrations**: https://github.com/settings/installations
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com

## After Removal

Once Vercel is removed:
1. **Only Render will deploy** your changes
2. **Check Render dashboard** to verify deployments
3. **Test your app** on Render URL

**⚠️ DO THIS NOW** - Without removing webhooks, Vercel will keep deploying!
