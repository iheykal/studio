# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Render Root Directory NOW

## The Problem
Render is looking for `package.json` in `/opt/render/project/src/` but it's actually in the root directory.

## ✅ SOLUTION: Change Root Directory in Render Dashboard

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Render Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Log in if needed

2. **Find Your Service**
   - Look for a service named something like:
     - `gemini-ludo-game`
     - `studio-1-rmo5`
     - `ludo-backend`
     - Or any service connected to `iheykal/studio` repository

3. **Click on the Service Name** to open it

4. **Go to Settings Tab**
   - Click on **"Settings"** in the left sidebar or top menu

5. **Find "Root Directory" Field**
   - Scroll down to the **"Build & Deploy"** section
   - Look for **"Root Directory"** field
   - It probably says: `src` ❌

6. **Change It**
   - **Delete** the value `src`
   - **Type**: `.` (just a dot)
   - OR **leave it completely empty**
   - Both `.` and empty mean "root directory"

7. **Save Changes**
   - Click **"Save Changes"** button at the bottom
   - Render will automatically start a new deployment

8. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Go to the **"Logs"** tab
   - Watch the build process
   - It should now find `package.json` in the root!

## 📸 What to Look For

**Before (WRONG):**
```
Root Directory: src
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
Root Directory: .
```
or
```
Root Directory: (empty)
```

## ⚠️ If You Can't Find the Setting

If you don't see "Root Directory" in Settings:
1. Make sure you're in the **Settings** tab (not Environment or Logs)
2. Scroll down - it's in the "Build & Deploy" section
3. If still not found, your service might be a "Static Site" - you may need to delete it and create a new "Web Service"

## 🔄 After Fixing

Once you change it and save:
- Render will automatically redeploy
- Check the Logs tab
- You should see: `Running build command 'npm install && npm run build && cd server && npm install'...`
- And it should find `package.json` successfully!

## ❓ Still Having Issues?

If you've changed it but still getting the error:
1. Make sure you clicked "Save Changes"
2. Wait for the new deployment to start (check the Events tab)
3. Check the Logs tab for the new build attempt
4. The error should be gone!
