# Security Improvements Implementation

This document outlines all the security measures implemented to prevent unauthorized balance increases and protect the application from hacking attempts.

## ✅ Implemented Security Features

### 1. **Rate Limiting**
- **Wallet endpoints**: Limited to 20 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Authentication endpoints**: Limited to 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Admin endpoints**: Limited to 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse

### 2. **Enhanced Input Validation**
- Strict amount validation with min/max limits ($0.01 - $100,000)
- Decimal place validation (max 2 decimal places)
- Type checking to prevent injection attacks
- All invalid inputs are logged as suspicious activity

### 3. **Audit Logging System**
- Comprehensive logging of all critical actions:
  - User creation
  - Deposit/withdrawal creation, approval, and rejection
  - Failed login attempts
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Balance reconciliation checks
  - Suspicious activities
- Logs include:
  - User ID and admin ID
  - IP address and user agent
  - Timestamp
  - Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Detailed action information

### 4. **Balance Reconciliation**
- Automatic balance verification after transaction approvals
- Calculates balance from transaction history
- Detects discrepancies between stored and calculated balances
- Logs mismatches with high severity
- Admin endpoint available: `POST /api/admin/users/:userId/reconcile`

### 5. **Database-Level Constraints**
- User balance cannot be negative (enforced at database level)
- Balance must be a valid finite number
- Prevents invalid data from being stored

### 6. **Improved CORS Configuration**
- Production: Only allows specific frontend URLs from environment variables
- Development: Allows localhost and local network IPs
- Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests

### 7. **JWT Secret Security**
- Warning system alerts if default JWT secret is used in production
- Requires strong JWT_SECRET environment variable
- Prevents token forgery attacks

### 8. **Transaction Integrity Checks**
- All balance-changing operations are logged
- Balance reconciliation runs after critical operations
- Transaction history is used to verify balance accuracy

## 🔒 Security Endpoints

### Admin-Only Security Endpoints

1. **Balance Reconciliation**
   ```
   POST /api/admin/users/:userId/reconcile
   ```
   - Reconciles a user's balance against transaction history
   - Returns mismatch information if detected

2. **Audit Logs**
   ```
   GET /api/admin/audit-logs
   ```
   - Query parameters: `userId`, `action`, `severity`, `limit`, `skip`
   - Returns comprehensive audit trail of all security events

## 🛡️ Protection Against Common Attacks

### 1. **Unauthorized Balance Increases**
- ✅ All balance changes require proper authentication
- ✅ Admin actions are logged and tracked
- ✅ Balance reconciliation detects discrepancies
- ✅ Database constraints prevent invalid balances
- ✅ Transaction history provides audit trail

### 2. **API Abuse**
- ✅ Rate limiting prevents excessive requests
- ✅ Input validation prevents invalid data
- ✅ Suspicious activities are logged

### 3. **Brute Force Attacks**
- ✅ Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- ✅ Failed login attempts are logged
- ✅ JWT tokens expire after 7 days

### 4. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- ✅ CORS restrictions limit allowed origins
- ✅ JWT tokens required for authenticated requests

### 5. **SQL/NoSQL Injection**
- ✅ Mongoose ODM provides built-in protection
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Parameterized queries

## 📋 Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# REQUIRED: Strong random string (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET=your-very-strong-random-secret-key-here

# REQUIRED: Frontend URL(s) in production (comma-separated)
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

# Optional: Node environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Set up alerts for:**
   - Balance mismatches (high severity audit logs)
   - Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
   - Unauthorized admin access attempts
   - Large balance changes

2. **Regular checks:**
   - Review audit logs weekly
   - Run balance reconciliation for all users monthly
   - Monitor rate limit violations
   - Check for suspicious activity patterns

3. **Database maintenance:**
   - Regular backups
   - Monitor database size and performance
   - Review transaction history for anomalies

## 🚨 Security Incident Response

If you detect unauthorized balance changes:

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Check audit logs: `GET /api/admin/audit-logs?severity=high`
   - Run balance reconciliation for affected users
   - Review transaction history
   - Check for suspicious IP addresses

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review all transactions for affected users
   - Check admin action logs
   - Identify the source of unauthorized access
   - Review CORS and authentication logs

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revoke compromised tokens if necessary
   - Update JWT_SECRET if compromised
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Correct any balance discrepancies

## 📊 Audit Log Severity Levels

- **low**: Normal operations (user creation, successful transactions)
- **medium**: Important actions (deposit/withdrawal approvals, failed logins)
- **high**: Security concerns (unauthorized access, balance mismatches)
- **critical**: Immediate security threats (requires immediate attention)

## 🔐 Additional Recommendations

1. **Use HTTPS in production** - Encrypt all communications
2. **Implement 2FA** - Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts
3. **Regular security audits** - Review code and dependencies regularly
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update npm packages
5. **Use a secrets manager** - Store JWT_SECRET in a secure secrets manager
6. **Implement IP whitelisting** - For admin endpoints in production
7. **Add request signing** - For critical operations
8. **Set up monitoring** - Use tools like Sentry or similar for error tracking

## 📝 Notes

- All security features are active by default
- Audit logging does not break the application if it fails (graceful degradation)
- Rate limiting uses IP addresses (consider user-based limiting for better UX)
- Balance reconciliation has a 1 cent tolerance for rounding differences
