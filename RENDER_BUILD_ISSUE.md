# Render Build Issue - Commit 446027f Not Found

## Problem
Render is building commit `446027f` with message "Fix syntax error in socketService.ts getDefaultSocketUrl method" but:
- This commit doesn't exist in local repository
- The update/fix is not showing in deployed version

## Possible Causes

### 1. Render Building Wrong Branch
Render might be configured to build from `master` instead of `main`:
- Check Render Dashboard → Settings → Repository
- **Branch should be**: `main` (not `master`)
- If it's set to `master`, change it to `main`

### 2. Commit Made on Different Branch
The commit `446027f` might be on a different branch:
- Check if it exists on `master` branch
- Check if it exists on a feature branch
- Merge it to `main` if needed

### 3. Build Cache Issue
Render might be using cached build:
- Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
- This forces a fresh build

### 4. Build Failing Silently
The build might be failing but Render shows "building":
- Check Render Logs tab
- Look for build errors
- Check if `npm run render:build` is completing successfully

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Render Branch Configuration
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on: `gemini-ludo-game` service
3. **Settings** → **Repository**
4. **Branch**: Should be `main` (not `master`)
5. If wrong, change it and save (triggers new deployment)

### Solution 2: Force Fresh Build
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. **Manual Deploy** → **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
3. Select: **"Deploy latest commit"**
4. Wait for build to complete

### Solution 3: Check Build Logs
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. **Logs** tab
3. Look for:
   - Build errors
   - "✓ built in X.XXs" (success message)
   - Any TypeScript/compilation errors
   - Missing dependencies

### Solution 4: Verify Latest Code is Pushed
Current latest commit: `dc970b0`
- Make sure this is what Render is building
- If Render shows different commit, there's a sync issue

## Current Status

**Local Repository:**
- Latest commit: `dc970b0` - "Add Render manual deploy and Vercel removal guides"
- Branch: `main`
- Status: Up to date with `origin/main`

**Render Should Be Building:**
- Commit: `dc970b0` or later
- Branch: `main`
- Build command: `npm run render:build`

## Next Steps

1. **Check Render Dashboard**:
   - What commit is it building?
   - What branch is configured?
   - Are there any build errors?

2. **If commit mismatch**:
   - Update branch to `main` in Render settings
   - Trigger manual deploy

3. **If build failing**:
   - Check logs for errors
   - Fix any syntax/compilation errors
   - Re-deploy

4. **If build succeeding but update not showing**:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Check if frontend is being served correctly
