# ⚠️ URGENT: Stop Vercel Deployments - Action Required

## The Problem
Vercel is still deploying your repository even though you want to use Render only.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### You MUST Disconnect Vercel in the Dashboard

**The code changes alone won't stop Vercel** - you need to disconnect it in the Vercel dashboard:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find project**: "studio" or "efficient-playfulness"  
3. **Click on the project**
4. **Go to**: Settings → Git
5. **Click**: "Disconnect" button
6. **Confirm** the disconnection

### Alternative: Disable Auto-Deploy

If you can't disconnect:
1. **Settings** → **Git**
2. **Toggle "Auto-Deploy"** to **OFF**
3. **Save**

## Why Code Changes Aren't Enough

- ✅ Renamed `vercel.json` → `vercel.json.disabled`
- ✅ Added `.vercelignore` file
- ❌ **BUT**: Vercel is still connected to your GitHub repo at the dashboard level
- ❌ **Vercel webhook** is still active in GitHub

## Check GitHub Webhooks

1. Go to: https://github.com/iheykal/studio/settings/hooks
2. Look for **Vercel webhooks**
3. **Delete** any Vercel webhooks you find

## Verify Render is Working

After disconnecting Vercel:

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Check service**: `gemini-ludo-game`
3. **Settings** → **Repository**: Should show `iheykal/studio` connected
4. **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**: Auto-Deploy should be "Yes"
5. **Manually trigger**: "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## Summary

**Code changes made:**
- ✅ `vercel.json.disabled` (renamed)
- ✅ `.vercelignore` (added)
- ✅ Documentation files

**Action YOU need to take:**
- ⚠️ **Disconnect Vercel in dashboard** (REQUIRED)
- ⚠️ **Delete Vercel webhooks in GitHub** (RECOMMENDED)
- ⚠️ **Verify Render connection** (CHECK)

Without disconnecting in the Vercel dashboard, Vercel will continue to deploy!
